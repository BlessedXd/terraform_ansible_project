# terraform_ansible_project
This project uses Terraform to deploy a VPC with public and private subnets, three EC2 instances, and a load balancer, while Ansible configures servers and deploys a sample Django application with a PostgreSQL database. The setup includes roles for infrastructure installation and application deployment.
